# coreutils-rs

This project attempts to clone the utilities in the [GNU
Coreutils](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/).

The motivation for this project is very simply for learning rust. The
coreutils are relatively simple tools, but sophisticated enough that
they present some interesting programming challenges.

If you're familiar with Unix-like systems, then implementing the
coreutils seems like a great way to learn a new systems language.
